Introduction:
As the population is increasing globally, the healthcare sector needs to collect the data and allocate data and resources to enhance operational efficiency, in order to improve patient care. So, healthcare systems are using big data analytics and data science for the above uses. So, to give accurate predictive analytics for healthcare data by using these technologies, is what this project is focused on.
 
Description of Artefact:
This artifact uses machine learning to analyze the data of healthcare centers, i.e., collect all sorts of data and analyze to predict the patient outcomes, so that we can identify the condition of each patient and provide proper treatment strategies for the patient.
Aim and Objectives:
Aim: 
to anticipate data of healthcare to provide treatment to the patients.
Objectives:
 Collect and refine the data from different sources and by using machine learning obtain data and compare the data to the real-world data and implement this artifact in the real world in the health care field.
Features of artifact:
•	Addition of all different and various healthcare data.
•	By using machine learning techniques developing foretelling data.
•	Judging the data to give insights to the experts in healthcare fields.
•	To implement this artifact in a wide range.
Advantages of this artifact:
This artifact collects the data in wide ranges and different places and adjusts the data which helps in improving patient care by giving the judgment from the data which is anticipated by using machine learning models. Because it detects the patient's condition by using data and provides treatment planning to the patients.
Intelleuctual challenge:
To handle the different and multiple data is a bit difficult. Because the data gets complicated to analyze data and also to refine it.
In developing the accurate and effective models for the healthcare field is bit difficult.
The challenges with data privacy and quality. 
Methodology of the artifact:
There are four stages in this artifact, which are
•	collect the data from diverse records and store it.
•	Then convert the raw data into useful data by cleaning and rectifying.
•	By using the Python language, skit-learn, and Jupiter notes develop the machine learning models.
•	At last assess the data by using the models and evaluate it. 
To obtain the accuracy and steadiness value we use the quantitative and qualitative methods and also this will be a repeated process, which means continuous rectification of the anticipated data from feedback from the experts.
Project relation to degree courses:
This project is connected to the Data Modeling, Management, and Governance module(22-23BLK2ACCIS108-6) in my study MSC Applied Computing and Information Technology with Project Management. That module emphasis on to convert raw data into useful data and use it. Using this data for the application in different fields. This module also deals with how to design data and reconstruct the data using SQL. this data is used in making the rational decision-making process for successful operations in their respective fields. So we are using this design module in a project to obtain the predictive analysis using machine learning models.
Project Risk Assessment Analysis:
Risks 	impact	mitigation
Data storage and volume of data	medium	Need to buy more storage place
Data quality	high	Using the iteration process for the data will help in refining the data output
Data privacy and security	high	Encrypting data and multifactor authentication can be used
Technology challenges	medium	Need to update the technology frequently in order to be competitive.
